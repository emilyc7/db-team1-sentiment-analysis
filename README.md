# This program is a sentiment analysis application that was given as an intern project for the Deutsche Bank intern class of 2019. Our project utilizes a Google Chrome extension to display the subject of the article (the company), the sentiment of the article, and a small summary of the article. On another tab of the extension, users will be able to browse related articles with sentiments, summaries, and external links to the article. On the final tab, the user will be able to see year-to-date stock data for the subject company. 
# More information about this application can be found in the docx document which serves as this project's white paper.
